The OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) is a certification exam provided by Offensive Security, aimed at information security professionals. Known for its hands-on, challenging nature, the OSCP is ideal for individuals seeking to deepen their understanding of penetration testing and cybersecurity offensive techniques. Here’s an overview of the OSCP exam:

### 1. **Exam Content and Objectives**
   - The OSCP certification focuses on penetration testing skills, where candidates must discover and exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated environment to achieve complete system compromise.
   - The goal of the exam is to test the candidate’s proficiency in vulnerability exploitation, script writing, network attacks, and mitigation measures. Ultimately, it aims to help organizations improve their defensive posture.

### 2. **Exam Structure**
   - **Duration**: The exam is a 24-hour remote, hands-on test, with an additional 24 hours for report preparation.
   - **Environment**: The candidate completes the exam in an isolated lab environment that typically includes multiple target machines.
   - **Tasks**: Candidates are required to conduct penetration tests on the target machines, obtain system privileges (both low and root-level) and collect designated flags.

### 3. **Scoring Criteria**
   - The exam has a maximum score of 100 points, with a passing score of 70 points.
   - Each target machine is worth different points, usually allocated based on privilege level—gaining low-level privileges may award 10 points, while gaining administrative access could award 20 points.
   - Candidates need to complete as many target tests as possible within the time limit.

### 4. **Tools and Techniques for the Exam**
   - Candidates can use various tools in Kali Linux, such as `Nmap`, `Metasploit`, and `Burp Suite`, and they are also allowed to write their own scripts to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.
   - OSCP emphasizes manual penetration testing and typically limits the use of automated tools like Metasploit.

### 5. **Preparation Requirements**
   - Candidates should have a solid foundation in networking, operating systems (especially Linux and Windows), scripting (such as Python and Bash), and experience with vulnerability exploitation.
   - The **PWK course** (Penetration Testing with Kali Linux) is the official training course for OSCP, recommended for candidates before the exam, as it provides many hands-on exercises similar to the exam.

### 6. **Report Writing**
   - After passing the exam, candidates must submit a complete penetration test report within 24 hours, detailing the process of discovering and exploiting each vulnerability.
   - Report quality may also affect scoring, as it demonstrates the candidate’s professionalism and documentation skills.
